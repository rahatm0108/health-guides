                                    <h4>Drink More Water</h4>
                                    Because the body is primarily composed of water, staying hydrated is crucial to your physical health. Staying properly hydrated helps the body's cells to function more efficiently.

                                    <h4>Exercise regularly</h4>
                                    Take a walk, ride a bike, or jog around the neighborhood. Push-ups, sit-ups, leg lifts, lunges, and stretching go a long way toward improving your health. Getting off the couch to play a sport or go on a hike as a family creates good habits and a healthier
                                    you.

                                    <h4>Eat more fruits and vegetables rather than unhealthy foods</h4>
                                    Fruits and vegetables contain natural vitamins and minerals your body needs to function optimally. Snack on apples instead of chips, enjoy a carrot instead of french fries. Because these unhealthy foods just lead to weight gain and sickness

                                    <h4>Sleep Well</h4>
                                    Sleep allows the body to restore itself, cells to repair themselves, and the brain to reboot. Seven or eight hours each night should be a good amount of sleep.
