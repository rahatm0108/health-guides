<h4>Eat more fruits and vegetables rather than unhealthy foods</h4>
 Fruits and vegetables contain natural vitamins and minerals your body needs to function optimally. Snack on apples instead of chips, enjoy a carrot instead of french fries. Because these unhealthy foods just lead to weight gain and sickness
